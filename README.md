## Introduction

Decision support is an important part of modern medical practice. Central to this decision support are various evidence-based calculations and algorithms. There are several tools on the internet that allow people to manually enter data to calculate values that aid clinicians as decision support, however to date a comprehensive API is not available in the open source space. `geekmdcalc-js` is a JavaScript library that addresses this knowledge-vaccum in the open-source community.

## Why JavaScript?

There are two major reasons.

1. This is an open-source project. JavaScript is ubiquitous, and developers are plentiful.
2. JavaScript can easily be integrated into front-end and back-end applications.
